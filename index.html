		<h2> What being a trainer in student's organization taught me? </h2>
		<p> A year ago, in January 2017, EESTEC Training Team asked me to write a short post about my journey as a trainer. On their request, I have created text that you can find below and that I want to share with you.</p>

**********

<p> From the time perspective, I see that it doesn’t really matter how you start. What matters is only how you finish. I hope you will find this text interesting, maybe even inspiring.</p>

For those of you who don't know me: my name is Michał. An EESTEC Trainer since 2013. I attended multiple trainig events, including two T4Ts (note: trainng for trainers). Last year, I was the Training Team Coordinator.

<p>For those of you who have known me since 2014 and later: when I joined EESTEC, I was very immature, especially during events. Drinking too much, climbing trees, interrupting trainers with my jokes during sessions - this kind of behaviour.</p>

"What has changed, Michał?", you may wonder. Great question, I am glad you asked. Short answer: I went to T4T.

<p>The idea of becoming a trainer had been growing inside me since my very first days in EESTEC. For some time, it was just a silly thought I didn't really pay attention to. And I still remember that flash moment in July 2012 at the Grant Team Operations Conference. During one training, it hit me: "I can be a trainer, too". Shortly after, I had made the decision that I will apply for T4T in 2013.</p>

Honestly, I don't know why I wanted this. I wrote something in the application for T4T, but when I check it now, I smile. Now I know that I just hadn’t been aware what I was signing up for. I am also not sure why I was selected for the T4T. Some of my behaviours were really questionable. I like to think that trainers had seen some potential in me.

<p>But I think that it doesn’t really matter how you start. What matters is only how you finish. I participated the 6th T4T.</p>

The real turnover point for me was the 7th T4T, though, where I went as a trainer. I had worked there with amazing people, much more experienced than me. Even if we were from the same generation they were far ahead of me. Those trainers motivated and challenged me. They helped me understand how little I know and how little I can do. They also helped me realize what I am good at, which was probably the most important lesson.

<p>I left Zurich feeling dissatisfied with my performance but also excited. I was excited because I knew I will have to work a lot, and much harder to be satisfied after the 8th T4T, and I have only a year to reach the right level. Today, I can gladly say that I succeeded.</p>

A lot of things have changed for me since I have joined EESTEC. What is my motivation to be a trainer now? I believe it doesn't really matter to you. What matters is what I do as a trainer. And I can share with you the 3 basic habits of mine:
<ol>
    <li>I want people to like me. Because others have to feel comfortable with me.</li>
    <li>I always keep all the promises I make. Because others have to know they can rely on me.</li>
    <li>I pay attention when I envy other people’s skills and achievements. Because that way I can see what I want to improve in myself. The easiest way to achieve something is to find someone who achieved it and ask how they did it.</li>
</ol>
And most importantly: I try to show others that if I could do it, so can they. After all, it really doesn’t matter how you start. What matters is only how you finish.  </p>
